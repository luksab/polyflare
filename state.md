# Ray tracing
- [x] naive ray tracing
  - [x] GPU implementation
- [x] sparse ray tracing
  - [x] GPU implementation
    - [x] ray tracing itself
    - [x] triangle area calculation
- [x] autodiff CPU version

# Rendering
- [x] naive
- [x] sparse
- [ ] autodiff 1/gradient as strength

# Fitting Polynomials
- [ ] proper ray generation 
- [ ] Dense polynomials - this is currently broken
  - [x] Sparse from polynomials
    - [ ] accelerate?
